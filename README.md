# The-Ultimate-VR-Forum-website
A website dedicated to infomation about anything and everything VR (currently only about vr treadmills).
I'm making this site both as a fun project to test new ideas and to provide a resource for others who own 
KatWalk VR treadmills in terms of potential problems, helpfull products, and a general place to chat.
